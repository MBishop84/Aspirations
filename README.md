# Aspirations

Welcome to my newest application. This one is build using .NET Aspire and is mostly for me to play around with and better understand various concepts in .NET.

The .Web project is built using the [Radzen](https://blazor.radzen.com/) component library, but I also plan on incorporating other components such as [BlazorMonaco](https://github.com/serdarciplak/BlazorMonaco) in the transformer page for user code input.

The .ApiService project is using the minimal api design with Entity Framework Core. I have it set up using the InMemoryDatabase and repositories that load data from json files so that I don't have to connect to a database. This setup should only be used for testing purposes and that's pretty much what I'm doing with it to learn the minimal api design.
